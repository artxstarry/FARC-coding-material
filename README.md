# FARC-coding-material
Code used by team FU0171 - VELO-REX for FARC finals hosted at FPTU Ha Noi.
Feel free to use the code if you are struggling with coding your Robot
Our code consists of:
- Controller inputs (Registering keys connected to parts)
- Arcade Driving (2 joysticks style, left move for/back, right turn left/right)
- Drivetrain code (2x Motors)
- Motors code (another 2x Motors)
- Servo code (2x Servo, one switches position, one sets degrees)
Lib used: PS2X_lib.h (from esp32 Makerbot, github.com/makerviet), Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h (included)
